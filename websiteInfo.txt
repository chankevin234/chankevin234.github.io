Hey There! My name�s Kevin and currently, I am a fourth year Business Technology Management student aspiring to become a Software Developer. My main goal is to develop and create real and meaningful impacts on all the projects I am working on!<br>As someone who interested in how the use of technology has disrupted traditional businesses, pursing my degree has allowed me to learn more about the intersection between both areas. While my degree focuses more on the business side of technology, this has actually motivated me to develop my technical knowledge independently ad explore topics outside of the classroom which I believe is the most important part of being a student! My co-op experiences have also given me the opportunity to explore the new technologies shaping our world today.<br>Ultimately, I hope to create real impacts and to learn more about new technologies that I can explore. Please feel free to connect with me as I'm always excited to talk with and meet new people!

DnDApp is a web application that allows users to create their own character sheets for their campaigns. Users can fill in important information such as their character's Name, Race, Stats (str, dex, con, etc.), Gold, Items, etc. This is done by using Python to access an open-source API to load information into CSV files. A library is then created using C++ which converts the data from the CSV files. This library is then accessed by the React App. 
<b>Tools Used:</b> React, Python, C++, and Open5e API 

In my third internship, I was a part of Manulife's Travel Insurance Team where I focused on implementing new COVID-19 insurance plans into a Full Stack Web Application using .NET Core, Adobe Experience Manager, HTML5/CSS, and Jenkins. My role revolved around the resolution of security issues brought up through Penetration Testing and through the analysis of website pages for AODA compliance. In addition to these responsibilities, I was given a task to improve user testing by creating and deploying a JMeter Tool using bash scripts to stress test APIs onto Pivotal Cloud Foundry to manage breakpoints in user traffic. This tool would allow users to test and store testing data onto the Cloud.
