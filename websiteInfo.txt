Hey There! My name’s Kevin and currently, I am a fourth year Business Technology Management student aspiring to become a Software Developer. My main goal is to develop and create real and meaningful impacts on all the projects I am working on!<br>As someone who interested in how the use of technology has disrupted traditional businesses, pursing my degree has allowed me to learn more about the intersection between both areas. While my degree focuses more on the business side of technology, this has actually motivated me to develop my technical knowledge independently ad explore topics outside of the classroom which I believe is the most important part of being a student! My co-op experiences have also given me the opportunity to explore the new technologies shaping our world today.<br>Ultimately, I hope to create real impacts and to learn more about new technologies that I can explore. Please feel free to connect with me as I'm always excited to talk with and meet new people!
